## Celebration of Max and Anna's Birthday

#### When: April 29th from 2 - ?? (Come whenever and stay till whenever)

#### Where: Max's House at [34 Conch Road, Narragansett](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/''/34+Conch+Rd,+Narragansett,+RI+02882/data=!4m5!4m4!1m0!1m2!1m1!1s0x89e5be5eba6be5fd:0x3931cda692c57dc2?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiGgNuKlZPTAhUG_mMKHWkFD20QwwUIIDAA)

#### We are designing this event as a celebration of beer. We will be providing samples from some of the 'greatest hits' we've had over the past year, 
along with some beer that we've brewed ourselves. We also encourage you to take part in the festivities by bringing some of your favorite beers to 
share with the rest of the party. There will also be lawn games, music, and overall good times. 



#### Parking: You **must** park in the Galilee parking lot and make the 3 minute walk to the house (if you have something to drop off it's fine to drive up to unload but the final resting spot must be the lot)
