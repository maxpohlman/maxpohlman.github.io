# ðŸŽ‰ Celebration of Max and Anna's Birthday ðŸŽ‰

### When: April 29th from 2 - ?? (Come whenever and stay till whenever)

### Where: Max's House at [34 Conch Road, Narragansett](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/''/34+Conch+Rd,+Narragansett,+RI+02882/data=!4m5!4m4!1m0!1m2!1m1!1s0x89e5be5eba6be5fd:0x3931cda692c57dc2?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiGgNuKlZPTAhUG_mMKHWkFD20QwwUIIDAA)

#### We are designing this event as a celebration of beer. We will be providing samples from some of the 'greatest hits' we've had over the past year, along with some beer that we've brewed ourselves. We also encourage you to take part in the festivities by bringing some of your favorite beers to share with the rest of the party. There will also be lawn games, music, and overall good times. **Expect to get drunk** 


What to bring: 
----------------
Please bring a **designated driver** with your carpool. If you're reading this you've likely been to Max's house and know that it is not large. Unless you talk with Max
beforehand, sleeping over is not allowed. It is the responsibility of your DD to get you back home.

A suggested beer:guest ratio is 3:1 meaning a six pack for each pair of people in your car. **Unique/off the beaten path beers are highly encouraged**. Even if you see something 
that looks cool/funky but it isn't something you like (perhaps you're an IPA person but see a carrot cake stout), please bring it anyways since all the beer is going into the same
pool to choose from. Your fellow guests will also likely praise you for your discovery! Please no beer hogging either - beer, especially brews with unique tastes, is ment to be enjoyed
as a group, so please share all the awesome stuff you bring with others, and sample the brews that other people bring!

 The following are good places to find good beer, and most of them do mix-a-six (which are also highly encouraged):

* [Bottles, Providence](http://bottlesfinewine.com/)

* [Nikki's Liquors, Providence](http://www.nikkisliquors.com)

* [Wines and Moore, Cranston](http://winesandmoreri.com/)

* [Wakefield Liquors, Wakefield](http://www.wakefieldliquors.com/)

* [Coastal Wines and Spirits, Branford](https://www.coastalwine.net/)

* [Craft Beer Cellar, Various MA Locations](https://craftbeercellar.com/)

**DO NOT BRING BUDWEISER, GANSETT, MILLER, ANYTHING 'LIGHT', OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S SHIT QUALITY. MAX WILL LITERALLY POUR IT OUT ONTO THE LAWN IN FRONT OF YOU AND SEND YOU TO WAKEFIELD
LIQUORS TO FIX YOUR MISTAKES. CHUG IT IN THE CAR IF YOU WANT BUT KEEP IT OFF THE PREMISES**

If you are not a fan of beer, we will have on hand a couple of funky spirits, but the selection will be much more limited. We highly recommend talking with Max or Azure for beer recommendations
as we will have a lot of beers on hand that will make you go 'I can't believe that's a beer'. However, you are still more than welcome to bring your own spirits with you. We will have
Coke on hand for mixing.

**SMOKING OF ANY VARIETY IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** (both inside and outside)

If you have any fun outdoor games (bocci, can-jam, ect), feel free to bring them along as well (or contact Max beforehand)

If people are feeling extra ambitious, you are more than welcome to bring food along with your beer. A small variety of snacks will be available. In addition, Max's house is ~5min
away from a "low quality but when you're drunk do you even care" pizza place and it is likely we will be placing multiple orders throughout the afternoon and evening.

Parking: 
------------------
You **must** park in the Galilee parking lot and make the 3 minute walk to the house (if you have something to drop off it's fine to drive up to unload but the final resting spot must be the lot)
