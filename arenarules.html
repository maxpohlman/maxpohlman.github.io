The only time you don't get points is if you haven't played 30% or more of the games for the week for that team.

If your personal rating is within 150 of your team rating, you get points based off the team rating. So even though your shaman is at 1678, it's within 150 of the team rating of 1816 so you'll get points based off 1816. If you're over 150 away from your team rating like your warrior is, you get points based off your personal rating (1236) instead of the team rating (1405)
