**I am currently a Program Evaluation Specialist at Censeo Consulting.
 My current research includes:** 
 
* Environmental and economic impacts of brownfield redevelopment

* Improving equity in water monitoring and access to federal remediation dollars 

* Increasing adoption of agricultural non-point source pollution management practices


** At Penn State, my research focused on: **

* Empirical effects of forested riparian buffers on water quality

* Nonmarket valuation of cleaner water and benefit distribution through an environmental justice lens

* Recreational demand for cleaner water

* Economic experimentation to get willingness-to-pay for public boat washing stations

* Modeling how boaters travel to identify common routes invasive species are spread (and which non-invaded waterbodies are most vulnerable)


I have a passion for presenting research through novel media such as R-Shiny apps and interactive markdown. My goal is to present meaningful economic findings in a clear, consise, and even fun way for stakeholders, communities, policy makers, and laypersons.
