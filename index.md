**I am a Masters candidate of the University of Rhode Island's Environmental and Natural Resource Economics Program.
I am a very data-driven person and I hope to continue to use and develop a very analytically heavy skillset as I begin my career.
 My primary research interests are:**

* Economic impacts of climate change on coastal communities

* Applying economic theory to solve environmental issues

* Econonomically efficient ways of improving healthcare 

* Using interactive visualizations to easily convey and present advanced data analysis 

* Construction of supervised learning modules to predict outcomes of economic, environmental, or healthcare trials and policies

**My current research and thesis are on the effects of uncertainty and ambiguity
on bargaining behavior in the context of dam removal. I am funded under a [NSF grant](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1539071)
regarding dam decision making.**
