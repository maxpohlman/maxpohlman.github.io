**I am currently pursuing a PhD in Energy, Environmental, and Food Economics at Penn State.
 My research at Penn State includes:** 
 
* Empirical effects of forested riparian buffers on water quality

* Nonmarket valuation of cleaner water and benefit distribution through an environmental justice lens

* Recreational demand for cleaner water

* Economic experimentation to get willingness-to-pay for public boat washing stations

* Modeling how boaters travel to identify common routes invasive species are spread (and which non-invaded waterbodies are most vulnerable)


I have a passion for presenting research through novel media such as R-Shiny apps and interactive markdown. My goal is to present meaningful economic findings in a clear, consise, and even fun way for stakeholders, communities, policy makers, and laypersons.
